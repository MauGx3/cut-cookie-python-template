# cut-cookie-python

## Introduction

This is a cookiecutter template for my personal use, so it's tailored for my taste, without any specific goal in mind.

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on [fpgmaas's](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-uv) template, it is extremely good and probably better than mine anyway, so you should check it out.

That project is partially based on [Audrey Feldroy\'s](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)\'s great [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage) repository.
