Archive of temporary files created during template flattening

- Archived folder: `flat-template-archived-by-agent/` â€” contains a copy of the flattened template used during maintenance.
- Scripts archived in place (overwritten with marker text):
  - `scripts/flatten_template.sh`
  - `scripts/flatten_into_root.sh`

If you want to permanently remove the archived folder, remove `flat-template-archived-by-agent/`.
